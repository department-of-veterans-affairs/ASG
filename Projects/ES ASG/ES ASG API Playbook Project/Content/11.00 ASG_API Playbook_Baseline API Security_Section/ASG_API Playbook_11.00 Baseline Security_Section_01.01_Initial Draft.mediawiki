== 11.2 OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Security ==

== Identity and Access Management (IAM) has implemented OAuth 2.0 services to allow API consumers to pass an OAuth token to APIs.  API gateways and API implementers can take advantage of the OAuth validation and session profile services to ensure tokens presented are valid and obtain information about the authenticated user.  An example end to end walkthrough of an OAuth Grant Code implementation using the IAM SSOe OAuth service can be found here (https://vaww.oed.portal.va.gov/sites/vrm/IAM/playbooks/Pages/SSOe/OAuth%20Code%20Grant.aspx). ==
